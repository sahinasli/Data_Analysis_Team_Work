<h3><strong>Questions & Problems Related to Course Topics</strong></h4>
<hr>


**1. Use the Sample - Superstore.xlsx data set to answer the questions below:**

   - What are the top 10 products in Appliances sub-category? Plot the question and then download & open the tableau file in this week's folder and examine.

   - Order of Operations in Tableau (read and discuss with the team)

The order of operations in Tableau, sometimes called the query pipeline, is the order in which Tableau performs various actions. Actions are also known as operations. Many operations apply filters, which means that as you build a view and add filters, those filters always execute in the order established by the order of operations.

Sometimes, you might expect Tableau to execute filters in one order, but the order of operations dictates that they be executed in a different order, which gives you unexpected results. When this happens, you can sometimes change the order in which operations are executed in the pipeline.
The Tableau order of operations includes the following, from top to bottom.

**2. Self study for DA&DVwPy. We have a brand new dataset for an EDA study. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will focus on overall Data Analyst job title, job description, salary estimate. You'll be analyzing a dataset that contains more than 2000 job listing for data analyst positions, with features such as **Salary Estimate**, **Location**, **Company Rating**, **Job Description** and more. You are expected to come up with different analyzes such as **finding the best jobs by salary and company rating**, **explore skills required in job descriptions**, **predict salary based on industry, location, company revenue**. Good luck!**
